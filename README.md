A simple macOS Desktop Application for testing Core Audio Input / Mixer and Output AUs

So far, have not had any luck with level meters on the MatrixMixer - and not been able to get simple playthrough working



Plan is to get Phase 1 working and then move on to ultimate goal, which is level metering of a mono audio stream split into a lowpass, bandpass, and hipass filter for 3 range metering
